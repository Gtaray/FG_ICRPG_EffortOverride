# Effort Override

Extension for Fantasy Grounds supporting Index Card RPG.

This extension allows a player to set the dice used for each type of effort by right clicking on the TOTAL box, then selecting "override effort die",
then further selecting the die size to die to override with. You can reset this back to defaults on the same menu.

Doing this will, for all purposes, replace the effort die that is rolled.

# Compatibility 
This extension is combatible with all other ICRPG extension, and will even work extensions that change the default effort types (Altered State or the Quickstart 2e).
